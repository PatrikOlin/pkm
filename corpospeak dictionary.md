Let's hit the ground running today
Let's drill down to the bottom of this issue
Whoa, the marketing team really dropped the ball
Frictionsless experience
Let's circle back later
It's an all hands on deck kind of day
We have decided to pivot
Feel free to ping me
This idea wont scale
Let's not boil the ocean on this one
Something something blockchain
We have to think outisde the box
No need to throw someone under the bus

Well, let's not boil the ocean on this

Today is an "all hands on deck" kind of day!
Actually, we have decided to put this on the backburner for now

We need to hit the ground running on this project
Actually, we have decided to pivot on this

Whoa, the marketing team really dropped the ball on this
There's no need to throw someone under the bus

This idea will never scale
We have already decided to pivot
