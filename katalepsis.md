_Katalepsis_ är en term i stoisk filosofi som betyder ungefär _förståelse_. Det var för stoikerna ett sätt att beskriva vår förmåga att greppa filosofiska koncept.

_Katalepsis_ is ‘comprehension’. And a _kataleptic phantasia_ is that which derives from an object which really exists. Therefore it is a copy of that object and can derive from no other object. For instance, we can see a meadow while walking in a countryside. But we can also see the same meadow in a perfect, gorgeous picture. Now, the first perception comes with perfumes and some breeze. While the second offers to us no scents and no wind. It means that the first perception shows some special features. Thus, it is a _kataleptic phantasia_. Also notice that the picture could well be the picture of a picture.
