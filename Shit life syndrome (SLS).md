Shit life syndrome (SLS) är en term som används av läkare i Storbrittanien och USA som en samlingsterm för dom effekter som fattigdom och missbruk kan ha på människor och på dom störningar som kan uppstå från detta. 

>Blackpool exports healthy skilled people and imports the unskilled, the unemployed and the unwell. As people overlooked by the modern economy wash up in a place that has also been left behind, the result is a quietly unfolding health crisis. More than a tenth of the town's working-age inhabitants live on state benefits paid to those deemed too sick to work. [Antidepressant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant "Antidepressant") prescription rates are among the highest in the country. [Life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy "Life expectancy"), already the lowest in England, has recently started to fall. Doctors in places such as this have a private diagnosis for what ails some of their patients: "Shit Life Syndrome" ... People with SLS really do have mental or physical health problems, doctors say. But they believe the causes are a tangled mix of economic, social and emotional problems that they — with 10- to 15-minute slots per patient — feel powerless to fix. The relationship between economics and health is blurry, complex and politically fraught. But it is too important to ignore.
